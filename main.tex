I would like to than Joseph Zubretsky, highest paid CEO of a health insurance company of all time, presumably because he provides 670x the value as me to the healthcare system. That's like having 1700 publications a year. What a great guy.

Research in dissertation formatting is a constantly evolving field. Someone is paid more than you to make sure you can't graduate unless the exact punctuation of your title matches the form you filled out, yet the school doesn't think the investment in making a formal thesis template is worth it.

\section{Motivation}

Paragraph 1: The motivations

Paragraph 1: What we know about the topic

Paragraph 3: What we don't know

Paragraph 4: Explicitly spell out research question

Paragraph 5: Contributions
%motivation: a practical example of a spatial VC+ML problem.


\section{Contributions}
%overview of dissertation contributions; what you do to answer the thesis question
This dissertation examines the issue of spatial data integration in VC+ML systems. 

\noindent The remainder of these chapters are structured by domain application, as described below. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Chapter 2 introduces the idea that banana flavored ice cream is inferior to just frozen bananas thrown in a blender.
    \item Chapter 3 proves that despite prior findings, milkshakes only bring boys to the yard with 90\% efficacy and that we need to introduce vegan, lactose free milkshakes as well to help close that gap.
\end{enumerate}

Chapters 2 and 3 are completed, published work.

\section{Background and Terminology}

\subsection{Terminology}
\textit{Terminology} Is the vocabulary of technical terms used in a particular field, subject, science, or art; nomenclature.

\subsection{Backgrounds in Dissertations}
Unnecessary background sections have existed since the stone age, where paleolithic hunters were known to describe the origins of sticks in cave paintings in order to give context to their drawings of them throwing sticks at animals.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:chapter1_introduction}

 \caption[Short text description that shows up in the table of contents]{AI depiction of what a banana might look like. Wow, isn't AI incredible? In the future when we've made banana's extinct due to global warming this may be our only way of knowing what these use to look like. Little is known about how they manage to just float there in mid air.}
 \label{fig:banananananananana}
\end{figure*}

Bananas~(\cref{fig:banananananananana}) are tasty. Banana-flavored ice-cream sucks. Y tho?


\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:chapter1_related_work}
Prior work has shown that people are willing to pay the cost of 6300 African people dying of Maleria to eat a single banana duct-taped to a wall. No work has replicated this finding with ice-cream duct-taped to a wall.

 
\section{Methods}
\subsection{Domain Background and Problem}
Bananas are a yellow fruit. Sometimes other colors. Despite being delicious, banana flavored candy isn't very good. Prior studies have also shown that the application of banana to pancakes have made women more likely to date me. This suggests a disconnect between banana \emph{as} flavor, and banana flavor. Little work has been done to explore the factors behind this disconnect.

\subsubsection{Design Process}
I made some banana smoothies. I then compared to ice-cream.

\subsubsection{Data processing}
Data was deleted and replaced with findings that fit my narrative. 

\section{Evaluation and Results}
\label{sec:chapter1_evaluation}
Mmm, banana.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
Bananananas

banas

banananas

banansna

bananas are hard to spell.

\section{Chapter Conclusion}
This chapter explored the importance of bananas in my mouth.

\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}

\section{Discussion}
You should watch Battlestar Galactica. It's pretty old but still holds up. Also much better than the name implies. 

\section{Conclusion}
Wow this is a really goog paper.

\chapter{Appendices}
%honestly I don't know how to fix the issue of the copyright permissions not being on the same space. For other appendices that are just pdfs use scaling on the first one e.g. 
%pagecommand={} makes the page number appear
%\includepdf[scale=.8,pagecommand={}]{pdf.pdf}

%to insert pdfs in the appendix without having the title on a seperate page inerst the first page as a scaled-down includgraphics
%maybe just make a pciture of them if you want to have the 2+ page setup on the first page
